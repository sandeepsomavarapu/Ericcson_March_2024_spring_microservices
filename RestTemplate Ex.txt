The RestTemplate provides a higher-level API over HTTP client libraries. It makes it easy to invoke REST endpoints in a single line.

Let's list out useful RestTemplate APIs:
getForObject - Retrieves a representation via GET.
getForEntity - Retrieves a ResponseEntity (that is, status, headers, and body) by using GET.
headForHeaders - Retrieves all headers for a resource by using HEAD.
postForLocation - Creates a new resource by using POST and returns the Location header from the response.
postForObject - Creates a new resource by using POST and returns the representation from the response.
postForEntity - Creates a new resource by using POST and returns the representation from the response.
put - Creates or updates a resource by using PUT.
patchForObject - Updates a resource by using PATCH and returns the representation from the response. Note that the JDK HttpURLConnection does not support the PATCH, but Apache HttpComponents and others do.
delete - Deletes the resources at the specified URI by using DELETE.
optionsForAllow - Retrieves allowed HTTP methods for a resource by using ALLOW.
exchange - A more generalized (and less opinionated) version of the preceding methods that provides extra flexibility when needed. It accepts a RequestEntity (including HTTP method, URL, headers, and body as input) and returns a ResponseEntity.
execute - The most generalized way to perform a request, with full control over request preparation and response extraction through callback interfaces.
